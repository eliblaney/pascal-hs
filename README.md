# pascal-hs

A simple project I made to mess around with Haskell.

## Description

Pascal-hs can generate an infinite series of rows in [Pascal's triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle).

You can use it to get an array of integers in the triangle, or a string to quickly print it on screen.
